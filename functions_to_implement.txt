FUNCTIONS TO IMPLEMENT:

FACTORY INITIALIZATION:

	- Choose communication ports
	- Open communication channel between Dashboard and Factory X
	- Pass port information to other factories
	- Open communication channel between Factory X and Factory Y
	- Integration in priority system of the new factory
	

GENERIC COMMUNICATION:

	
	- Start communication between Dashboard and Factory X
	- Start communication between Factory X and Factory Y
	- End communication between Dashboard and Factory X
	- End communication between Factory X and Factory Y
	- Broadcast alarm status
	- Receive alarm status
	- Broadcast information to other Factories every 5 seconds
	- Receive information from Factory X every 5 seconds
	
GPIO CONTROL:

	- GPIO list
	- GPIO status (indiv / all)
	- Set GPIO state (high / low)
	- Set GPIO config (in / out)
	
EXTERNAL INTERACTION WITH ACTUATORS:

	- Get list of actuators
	- Get Actuator X status
	- Set Actuator X status
	- Get Actuator X config
	- Set Actuator X config
	

EXTERNAL INTERACTION WITH SENSORS:

	- Get list of sensors
	- Set threshold for Sensor X
	- Get value of Sensor X

SENSOR HANDLING:

	- Retrieve value from Sensor X
	- Check thresholds
	- Trigger alarm
